  overview: [
    "Do not treat this module lightly. I have friends who did so and scored below B. This is MA1521 v2.0",
    "Well, there is a clear reason why I put the warning box above. Many have claimed this module to be like MA1521. All you need to do is to just study one day before the exams and you are done. NO.",
    "The lecture content may be easy at the start, it gets progressively difficult as more content is added.",
    "if you have trouble with MA1521, you might have trouble with ST2334. There is a lot of calculus involved in the module and it is important that you revise basic calculus before taking this module. Plus the fact that this module does not have an S/U Option, there is no reason to leave this till the last minute.",
    "Overall, if you put in consistent effort and do not take this module too lightly, you should do sufficiently fine.",

  workload: [
    "3/10",
    "Doing tutorials and Past Year Papers should warrant you a pass. Lectures are webcasted, but good to go if you have a group of friends.",
  ],
  difficulty: [
    "6/10",
    "The questions are not as simple as MA1521 clearly. Sufficient understanding and practice is needed befroe you can confidently grasp the concepts involved in this module.",
