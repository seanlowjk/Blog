  overview: [
    "As a Computing Student, I had no idea what I was writing more than half the time. But I did enjoy this module very much.",
    "If you are interested in Sociology, this module it's good for you. There are not too many readings to do, as compared to a typical FASS module. However, if you are not a very articulate person and have bad writing skills, maybe this module is not the module for you. (Unless you wish to take it and SU it just like me).",
    "The lecturer is engaging and she occasionally brings down guest speakers to share about their perceptions on major events in Singapore in a non-conventional way.",
    "Overall, I had problems due to me screwing up the Presentation and Mid-Terms, so I fared average for this module. If you are interested in writing and speaking about the social aspects of Singapore, this module might be a good fit for you!",

  workload: [
    "7/10",
    "Not many readings but still quite a bit. Both Exams are closed-book so memory work is needed.",
