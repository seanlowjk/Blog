  overview: [
    "Please do learn a bit of Vim and CLI before taking this module. You will be mainly using these two tools for your practical assessments, which take up 35% of your overall grade.",
    "This is a module which requires a lot of effort. As compared to CS1101S, I feel that the workload is definitely higher. If you come from CS1010S / CS1101S, do be prepared to take a leap of faith from Python / Source to Java.",
    "Do not be fooled by this module. Despite this module mainly teaching you Java, you are expected to have basic knowledge of Java syntax and such.",
    "The main killer will be the labs and the practical assessments. If you do not have enough practice and understanding, you might struggle in this module. The Labs are not trivial and some labs might take a whole week to finish. On the other hand, the practical assessments are challenging to complete and definitely a nightmare to face if you do not have sufficient understanding of the concepts taught in lectures and in the labs.",
    "Overall, you definitely need to put in a lot of effort for this module. Despite this module having heavy emphasis on the practical components, you are expected to attempt the weekly tutorials and learn how to code by hand also. (Yes it feels bad)",

  workload: [
    "11/10",
    "Proper Time Management is necessary for this module. If you have trouble in the early weeks of the semester, do not hesitate to ask your friends or TAs for help.",

    "9/10",
    "Concepts are pretty abstract and you might fall behind at certain points. Good to have study groups th help each other out of lab assignments and tutorials.",
