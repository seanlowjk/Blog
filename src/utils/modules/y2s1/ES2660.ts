  overview: [
    "High workload, but one of the most enjoyable modules so far.",
    "It really brings you on a whole new level of critical thinking. Most of the time, you are required to stand in front of a class to do a mini two minute speech on a random topic or in the form of a group presentation.",
    "As an individual who finds it difficult to express himself, I had trouble with the module. But thanks to a good teacher and a couple of good friends, I managed to get a lot out of this module in terms of impromptu speech and communication in terms of relaying my ideas and presenting oneself. These skills have become a very important part of my teaching here in NUS.",
