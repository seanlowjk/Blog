  overview: [
    "One of the modules I really enjoyed in NUS! Do note that for MA1101R under Prof. Dilip, you are allowed to use a GC for midterms and finals.",
    "Proving techniques are definitely important here, but the proving techniques here as not as difficult compared to CS1101S. As a result, i would recommend taking CS1231 before or at the same time while taking MA1101R. The Assignments can be pretty challenging so it would be good if you discuss it with your fellow peers. The Lab Quiz is Take-Home so you do not need to worry too much about using MATLAB.",
    "Midterms and Finals can be challenging but as long as you constantly do your tutorials and attempt the past year papers, you should be able to do quite well.",
