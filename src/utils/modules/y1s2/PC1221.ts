  overview: [
    "As an individual who disliked physics, I enjoyed this module a lot.",
    "Prof Tay has always something new to share with us every lecture and I definitely enjoyed the content that he shared with us throughout the semester, making the content relatable to us NUS students.",
    "Content-wise, it is really heavy. It is squeezing half of A-Level H2 physics into 3 months which can be really challenging to those who haven't touched physics in a long while. (Like me) Labs are really tedious and long (3 hours!) and preparation is really a hassle. Always remember to wear long pants! Midterms are pretty do-able as long you attempt the past year papers and attend Prof Tay's extra lessons.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed this module, not so much the workload.",
  ],
  workload: [
    "10/10",
    "Labs are a nightmare. Tutorials are optional but strongly recommended to go as they will cover on past year questions on a topical basis.g",

  difficulty: [
    "8/10",
    "One does not simply expect 50% of H2 Physics squeezed into 3 months to be a piece of cake..",
