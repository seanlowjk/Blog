  overview: [
    "If you haven't had experience with Git and Version Control, this module will force you to do so.",
    "This module is really heavy in terms of workload. As a result, it is best to balance this out with a couple of UEs or GEMs. During the first half of the semester, you will be required to learn GIt by yourself and manage a simple Java Application using Git.",
    "This will prepare you for the transition into the team project during the second half of the semester. More than half the time, you will be required to draw UML Diagrams and write tons of documentation for your project which will be quite a big component. Not nly that, testing is also important to ensure that your project doesn't get faulted for too many bugs during the practical assessment.",
    "You should find good teammates in CS2101 to work with so that you would not have too many issues in your Team Project for CS2103/T. It is important to mention that all members cannot be from the same nationality. If you have not fared too well in the Team Project, Finals will be a good chance for you to save your grade for this module.",
    "Overall, put in consistent effort for your projects while revising concepts taught in lectures and you should be able to secure at least a B+",
