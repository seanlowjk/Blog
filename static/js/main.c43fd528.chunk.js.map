related to software engineering principles covered in\n        CS2103/T or CS2113/T. However, this is a good read also for current\n        CS2030 students.\n      </Alert>\n\n      <h3>Context</h3>\n      <p>\n        This is a technical retrospective on the decisions made when developing\n        different aspects of NodeFlair's product. This is done to hopefully make\n        better decisions down the road. In this case, it was NodeFlair's\n        revamped onboarding form that is in question, when we were planning for\n        a review page.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Using the DRY Principle</h3>\n      <p>\n        In Software Engineering, the DRY principle aims at reducing repetition\n        of code. Let's say for example, we have the following class Structure:\n        We have a class called Animal and we have a class called Dog which is a\n        child class of Animal. As we know Dog is-a Animal, it is not really\n        necessary to repeat the attributes and methods of Animal into Dog!\n        Duplication in logic should be eliminated. It suggests that by copy and\n        pasting duplicate logic, the code writer does not have a good\n        understanding of how the code comes into play and a poor understanding\n        of abstraction. Unnecessary code to a code base results in an\n        unnecessary increase in the amount work needed to maintain the code base\n        and create additional tests just to handle the presence of these\n        duplicate code.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>What did you do?</h3>\n      <p>\n        For Nodeflair's revamped onboarding form, it did not have a review page\n        initially.\n      </p>\n\n      <Figure>\n        <Figure.Image\n          alt=\"State Machine 1\"\n          src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42912708/88661223-be408900-d10a-11ea-8efd-2651ede62a69.png\"\n        />\n        <Figure.Caption>\n          Figure 1. Original State Machine for Onboarding form.\n        </Figure.Caption>\n      </Figure>\n\n      <p>\n        We can express the original onboarding form logic as a state machines as\n        shown in Figure 1.\n      </p>\n\n      <Figure>\n        <Figure.Image\n          alt=\"State Machine 2\"\n          src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42912708/88661237-c7315a80-d10a-11ea-9e03-dd21bfd8ede0.png\"\n        />\n        <Figure.Caption>Figure 2. States for Review Page</Figure.Caption>\n      </Figure>\n\n      <p>\n        As a result, we would need to modify the buttons such that Next should\n        not appear, which redirects the yser to the next page. Instead, it's\n        replaced by another button Back To Review which returns the user to the\n        review page.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        However, there is an issue that users would not be able to see all their\n        details on one entire page. Hence, the need for the review page to\n        enhance the user's journey. With the addition of the review page, we can\n        have additional states which helps redirect the user to the page which\n        the user has components he or she wishes to edit.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>The Mistake</h3>\n\n      <p>\n        I had decided to replicate the jsx component for each page into a new\n        ppage with a modified BottomComponent with the new button. However, this\n        results in a huge amount of repeated code, which is actually\n        unnecessary. This would result in quite a bit of overhead and that it is\n        not really wise to handle such a practice.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>The Solution</h3>\n\n      <p>\n        As a result, we could actually just modify the BottomComponent and\n        create a new component called ReviewBottomComponent which handles the\n        state logic from Figure 2. As a result, we do not actually need to\n        create 4 new pages just to handle the review state logic! It saves time\n        and effort while following the principle of not repeating oneself.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2> What did you learn?</h2>\n\n      <h3>Planning before you act.</h3>\n\n      <p>\n        Do not rush into things. Just because some ways seem faster and more\n        convenient, it does not indicate that we should forgo our good software\n        engineering practices. In this article, I made the mistake of just\n        repeating the code used for all 4 pages and making 4 new pages just for\n        the sole purpose of creating a new BottomComponent.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Child Components and Parent Components.</h3>\n\n      <p>\n        As much as possible, if there is already a child component in the parent\n        component which handles that particular set of logic, we should make use\n        of it as much as possible. In this case, our Page has-a BottomComponent.\n        As a result, we can just make use of the BottomComponent and create an\n        alternative ReviewBottomComponent to handle the review state logic. If\n        our Page does not have a BottomComponent, we should take responsibility\n        by abstracting out the code such that we have create a component with\n        similar functionality to that of a BottomComponent. From there, we can\n        follow what we did in the earlier paragraph.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Would you do it again?</h3>\n\n      <p>\n        Nope. It does not make sense to repeat so much code just for a simple\n        purpose. Please do remember to plan before coding!\n      </p>\n\n      <Button variant=\"dark\" href=\"/blog/#/misc/\">\n        Back To Posts\n      </Button>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default DRY;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Button, Card, Figure } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\nfunction Teaching() {\n  return (\n    <Card className=\"blog-content\">\n      <h1> My Teaching Career in NUS </h1>\n      <br />\n\n      <h3>My Teaching Experiences</h3>\n      <p>\n        Looking throughout my teaching journey in NUS, I have been part-time\n        teaching in the School of Computing (SoC) for 2.5 years. \n        <br></br>\n        I have taught the following modules in NUS: \n        <br></br>\n        - CS1101S Programming Methodology<br></br>\n        - CS2030/S Programming Methodology II<br></br>\n        - CS2102 Database Systems \n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Common Misconceptions</h3>\n      <p>\n        1. Prior to contrary belief, you do not need a super-duper grade to teach \n        in SoC. I have scored an average of A- for the 3 above modules. \n        <br></br>\n        2. You do not need to be a know-it-all kind of person. It is okay to not \n        know how to answer certain questions during class. However, you should take\n        the responsibility to get back to them on these unanswered questions that \n        you are not sure of. \n        <br></br>\n        3. DO NOT <b>SPOONFEED</b>. By providing answers, it doesn't really prove that\n        your students will understand. Go through the thought process and, explain\n        in layman terms if needed. \n      </p>\n\n      <h3>How I deal with Online Classes</h3>\n      <p>\n        During the past few semesters, most lessons had to be mounted online\n        via Zoom due to the COVID-19 Situation. As a result, things must be \n        done different. <br></br>\n\n        1. I usually do not force people to turn on their cameras despite there being \n        class participation. This is because tutorial lessons are meant to be a safe \n        space for interaction and I do my best to try to keep things as comfortable \n        as possible. <br></br>\n        2. Using Zoom Annotations. One good thing that I found while student was \n        presenting was to use Annotations to <b>direct the attention</b> of students\n        to the important parts which were needed.  <br></br>\n      <Figure>\n        <Figure.Image\n          alt=\"Annotations\"\n          src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42912708/147327032-899c530b-e6a1-46ce-aa19-f4053bb2ca82.png\"\n        />\n        <Figure.Caption>\n          Figure 1. Zoom Annotations used during Class Participation\n        </Figure.Caption>\n      </Figure>\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Dealing with Classes in General</h3>\n      <p>\n        1. Recap the content beforehand. Usually, it would be good to tie in the \n        learning objectives from the previous lecture with the current tutorial / lab \n        lesson such that it becomes more relatable, and at the same time, help to \n        clarify questions before the tutorial or lab.  <br></br>\n        2. Being approachable is <b>super important</b> as it helps with interacting with \n        your students. Turn on your camera even though your students might not. \n        Try to get to know each other before the class starts, do some chit-chat and \n        understand if they have any issues with the lessons thus far. This brings me \n        to my next point. <br></br>\n        3. Staying contactable. By this, I <b>DO NOT</b> mean being online for your students\n        24/7. After all, you are a student as well and must manage your own modules. \n        What I mean by this is to create a chat group so that the tutorial group can \n        ask and discuss about queries about the module. Not only do you have the chance \n        to understand the areas in which some of your students might be struggling in, \n        but also give another avenue for interaction to take place. \n      </p>\n\n      <h3>The Good</h3>\n      <p>\n        Well, there were plenty of great feedback from my students from the past few \n        years. I would like to point out some of these comments to elaborate on the \n        points which I have mentioned earlier. \n\n        <Figure>\n        <Figure.Image\n          alt=\"Feedback-1\"\n          src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42912708/147327217-fadf9ef2-d384-4d02-bb2d-c77df10967e0.png\"\n        />\n      </Figure>\n\n        As I mentioned, one important factor is <b>to be approachable.</b> If you \n        are willing and able to listen, naturally, you would be able to build somewhat good\n        camaraderie with your students. \n\n        <Figure>\n        <Figure.Image\n          alt=\"Feedback-2\"\n          src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42912708/147327224-7385a13d-c625-49f3-b0a3-ae46799ed64f.png\"\n        />\n      </Figure>\n\n        As mentioned, do take the opportunity to talk with your students and get to know \n        them. Do your best to ensure that your students take something away from the lesson \n        and if not, do approach them if needed. After all, your students are the spotlight \n        for your teaching stint. \n      </p>\n\n      <h3>The Not-So-Good</h3>\n      <p>\n        Mainly it has to do with speaking speed. It will be good to stand in front of a mirror\n        and observe how you speak and present. Unfortunately, I usually tend to speak too fast \n        which is a downside. \n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Teaching Feedback</h3>\n      <p>\n        <Figure>\n            <Figure.Image\n            alt=\"Teaching-Feedback-CAP\"\n            src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42912708/147327411-def7aa64-57b7-460c-bca2-b8f977e9de17.png\"\n            />\n            <Figure.Caption>\n            Figure 2. Teaching Feedback Rating\n            </Figure.Caption>\n        </Figure>\n\n        Over the past 5 semesters, I have generally received positive feedback. What I want to say\n        is that if you put in the effort to understand your students and establish good \n        camaraderie with your students, you can make a good impact on them and, make new friends\n        along the way as well. \n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Concluding Thoughts</h3>\n      <p>\n        For those that wish to apply as a teaching assistant in SoC, do know that it is not going to \n        be an easy journey as it can be a time-sink. Do more than the minimum, and you'll\n        be amazed at the impact that you can leave on your students. \n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n          Thank you for reading and have a great day! <br></br>\n      </p>\n\n      <Button variant=\"dark\" href=\"/blog/#/misc/\">\n        Back To Posts\n      </Button>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Teaching;\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nimport { MiscCardInfo } from \"./MiscTypes\";\nimport DRY from \"../components/posts/DRY\";\nimport Teaching from \"../components/posts/Teaching\";\n\nexport const MiscCardInfos: MiscCardInfo[] = [\n  {\n    title: \"Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)\",\n    subtitle:\n      \"This article talks about some bad practices i did during my internship\",\n    href: \"/misc/dry\",\n    content: <DRY />,\n  },\n  {\n    title: \"My Teaching Career in NUS\",\n    subtitle:\n      \"This article talks about my part-time teaching experience in NUS\",\n    href: \"/misc/teaching\",\n    content: <Teaching />,\n  },\n];\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Card } from \"react-bootstrap\";\nimport MiscCard from \"../components/misc/MiscCard\";\nimport Introduction from \"../components/Introduction\";\nimport { MiscCardInfos } from \"../utils/MiscConstants\";\n\ntype MiscProps = {};\n\nfunction Misc(props: MiscProps) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"Misc\">\n      <Introduction\n        title={\"Other Posts\"}\n        subtitle={\"Sharing Knowledge is Great! :D\"}\n      />\n      <div>\n        <Card className=\"misc-container\">\n          <Card.Body className=\"misc-cards\">\n            {MiscCardInfos.map((info) => (\n              <MiscCard\n                title={info.title}\n                subtitle={info.subtitle}\n                href={info.href}\n              />\n            ))}\n          </Card.Body>\n        </Card>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Misc;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Container } from \"react-bootstrap\";\n\ntype BlogPostProps = {\n  content: JSX.Element;\n};\n\nfunction BlogPost(props: BlogPostProps) {\n  const { content } = props;\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"Blog\">\n      <Container className=\"blog-container\">{content}</Container>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default BlogPost;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { HashRouter, Route, Switch } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nimport Main from \"./pages/Main\";\nimport Modules from \"./pages/Modules\";\nimport Header from \"./components/Header\";\nimport ModuleReview from \"./components/modules/ModuleReview\";\nimport Contact from \"./components/contact/Contact\";\nimport { ModuleContents } from \"./utils/ModuleContsants\";\nimport Misc from \"./pages/Misc\";\nimport { MiscCardInfos } from \"./utils/MiscConstants\";\nimport BlogPost from \"./components/common/BlogPost\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {\n        <HashRouter basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL}>\n          <Header />\n          <Switch>\n            <Route path=\"/\" exact={true} render={Main} />\n            <Route path=\"/modules\" exact={true} render={Modules} />\n            <Route path=\"/misc\" exact={true} render={Misc} />\n\n            {ModuleContents.map((semester) =>\n              semester.modules\n                .filter((module) => module.content)\n                .map((module) => (\n                  <Route\n                    path={module.content?.link}\n                    component={() => (\n                      <ModuleReview\n                        title={module.title}\n                        content={module.content}\n                      />\n                    )}\n                  />\n                ))\n            )}\n\n            {MiscCardInfos.map((info) => (\n              <Route\n                path={info.href}\n                exact={true}\n                component={() => <BlogPost content={info.content} />}\n              />\n            ))}\n          </Switch>\n        </HashRouter>\n      }\n      <Contact />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
